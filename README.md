# Kidney Disease Detection 

A CNN..


## 📊 Project Context

Kidney diseases are a significant global health problem, often leading to serious complications if not detected early. This project leverages **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** to automatically classify kidney-related conditions from **CT scan images**, assisting healthcare professionals in early diagnosis.

### Why Kidney Disease Classification?
- Kidney diseases affect **over 10% of the world's population**.
- Early detection is critical to avoid **kidney failure** and improve patient outcomes.
- Automated classification systems reduce the workload of radiologists and improve diagnosis speed.

### Example of Kidney CT Scan Image:
